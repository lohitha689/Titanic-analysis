# Titanic Survival Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to extract insights about passenger survival patterns.

## 📁 Dataset
- `train.csv` – Titanic training dataset with passenger details and survival status.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Analysis
- Survival rate by gender, class, fare, and age
- Distribution plots (histograms, boxplots)
- Correlation heatmap to identify feature relationships

## 📄 Outputs
- `titanic_eda_visuals.pdf` – PDF report of key visualizations
- `titanic_eda.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with all code and analysis (if included)

## 📌 Key Insights
- Females had a significantly higher survival rate
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive
- Younger passengers and those who paid higher fares had better chances of survival
